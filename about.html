<div id="about">
<p>The aim of this project is to recreate the documentation of the
<a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Eventorbot">Eventorbot! Open source 3D
printer</a> in <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>
format. Although the printer itself is a <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> project, it has
been documented with Google's SketchUp program which isn't free at all and
can't work under GNU/Linux (or any other free operating system probably),
even with the help of <a href="http://www.winehq.org">Wine</a>.</p>

<p>The other motivation is that the original steel frame was made of 2"Â½
profile which is not available in some parts of the world where you
can buy 60x60 mm without any problems.</p>
