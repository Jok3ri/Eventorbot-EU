<p>
Today I received the parcel I had ordered at Gadgets3D. However, they
have web stores that deliver to EU and worldwide with prices in Euro
and US dollars, respectively, they are Polish company and if you ask
them they are willing to charge you in złoty and avoid additional
exchange cost. In the parcel there were pieces of <a href="http://gadgets3d.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=62&product_id=87">RAMPS 1.4. STARTER
SET</a> and a spool of <a href="http://gadgets3d.eu/index.php?route=product/product&path=60&product_id=98">orange PLA</a>. I've got yet to find out in practice
but the set seems to be more than enough to build my machine.

Sadly it's a fake Arduiono, however guys at G3D haven't claimed
it is genuine.

I've got no experience with such motors. In case of most DC
motors connecting their leads together makes it hard to turn a
shaft. In case of these I cant turn a shaft at all. This means
the winding resistance is very low, good thing.
