* Eventorbot-EU

The aim of this project is to recreate the documentation of the
[[http://reprap.org/wiki/Eventorbot][Eventorbot! Open source 3D printer]] in [[http://www.openscad.org/][OpenSCAD]] format. Although the
printer itself is a [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][free]] project, it has been documented with Google's
SketchUp program which isn't free at all and can't work under
GNU/Linux (or any other free operating system, probably), even with the
help of [[http://www.winehq.org][Wine]].

The other motivation is that the original steel frame was made of 2"Â½
profile which is not available in some parts of the world where you
can buy 60x60 mm without any problems.

* Original work

The original [[http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28915][Eventorbot! Open source 3D printer]] has been designed by
